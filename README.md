# artificial-intelligence

The project files from Artifiical Intelligence course at DePaul University

There are three different sections of Artificial Intelligence that I created a project for:
  * Basic Search Algorithms
  * Minimax Algorithm
  * Neural Network Algorithm

In each folder, there includes the Java files, any needed .txt files, and a write-up of the algorithm performance.
